FACE DETECTION: SIMPLE
code by Jeff Thompson | 2021 | jeffreythompson.org

Teaching computers to see faces has been around in 
various forms since the 1960s. In the 1990s and early 
2000s, techniques like Eigenfaces and Viola-Jones
allowed not just detecting faces but identifying
features. Today, facial recognition is embedded in
our smartphones and social media apps, allowing for
super fast, accurate, and even 3D face tracking!

There are lots of libraries for doing face detection,
but Google's TensorFlow library has several models
that work really well. This example uses BlazeFace,
which tracks six features and is really fast!
